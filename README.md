## Revision Report

### Increment 3.1 - Week of October 23 Resubmission
+ I am resubmitting because I didn't have a loss condition. I didn't know that not having a loss condition would be a problem as long as all of the requirements were met, but apparently it was, so I added a loss
condition to the game. I also fixed having a space in my main menu folder and replaced the space with an underscore.

### Increment 3.1 Week of November 19 Resubmission
+ I figured out what you meant by more conflict and added more interactivity to the game. You now shoot floating cubes by aiming the cannon and pressing space.
